Fundamental Beam Calculator

This code is part of the doctoral thesis work for Armen Amirkhanian at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. This code will calculate the deflection of a beam on a Winkler foundation. It deforms the beams via temperature and/or moisture gradients. It also accounts for the self-weight restraint. If the foundation is stiff enough, the beam may lose contact during deformations. The code attempts to estimate the point at which contact is lost and then switches calculation procedures to determine the deflections at the end of the beam.

This code has no brain, use your own.

This code is released under the MIT license.
